> This plugin was written for CodeMirror 5 and isn't compatible with CodeMirror 6 (which is the default since Joplin 3.1.x).  
> For the new CodeMirror version, I recommend this plugin: [Extended Markdown editor settings](https://github.com/personalizedrefrigerator/joplin-plugin-extra-editor-settings)

This is a simple plugin for [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) that exposes some CodeMirror options to the user, such as line wrapping or line numbers.

> **Note**:
> This plugin only affects the Markdown editor (CodeMirror), not the WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE).

## Development

<details>
<summary>Text from "generator-joplin"</summary>

This is a template to create a new Joplin plugin.

The main two files you will want to look at are:

- `/src/index.ts`, which contains the entry point for the plugin source code.
- `/src/manifest.json`, which is the plugin manifest. It contains information such as the plugin a name, version, etc.

## Building the plugin

The plugin is built using Webpack, which creates the compiled code in `/dist`. A JPL archive will also be created at the root, which can use to distribute the plugin.

To build the plugin, simply run `npm run dist`.

The project is setup to use TypeScript, although you can change the configuration to use plain JavaScript.

## Updating the plugin framework

To update the plugin framework, run `npm run update`.

In general this command tries to do the right thing - in particular it's going to merge the changes in package.json and .gitignore instead of overwriting. It will also leave "/src" as well as README.md untouched.

The file that may cause problem is "webpack.config.js" because it's going to be overwritten. For that reason, if you want to change it, consider creating a separate JavaScript file and include it in webpack.config.js. That way, when you update, you only have to restore the line that include your file.
